      <h1>Happy Birthday, Vinay</h1>
      <h2>From Your Sister, With Love</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Dear Vinay,</p>

    <p>
      Today is your birthday — a day to celebrate the person you are, and the journey we’ve shared.
      Ours hasn’t been the most conventional story… we weren’t born under the same roof, yet somehow,
      life decided we’d walk this path together.
    </p>

    <p>
      We haven’t always seen eye to eye. We haven’t always understood each other perfectly.
      But through every silence, every pause, and every effort — one truth remains steady:
      <strong>you became my brother</strong>, not by chance, but through something deeper.
    </p>

    <p>
      On your special day, I’m not giving you grand speeches or loud affection. Instead,
      I’m giving you something more honest — a part of me in words. Words I’ve often kept quiet,
      but feel right to offer now.
    </p>

    <div class="poem">
<strong>"What You Don’t Always See"</strong><br><br>
We weren’t born under the same roof,<br>
But still, our bond became the proof<br>
That sometimes life can gently tie<br>
Two people close, without a why.<br>
You weren’t my brother from the start —<br>
But you grew into that space in my heart.<br><br>

I know I’m not the loudest one,<br>
I don’t show love like others have done.<br>
But every effort, small or deep,<br>
Is one I give, not one I keep.<br>
I only try this hard, you see,<br>
For those who truly matter to me.<br><br>

And yes, I feel a quiet guilt,<br>
For every gap we’ve ever built.<br>
For times I wasn’t fully there,<br>
For moments lost in missed-out care.<br>
But don't mistake my guilt as fear,<br>
Or think I’ll bow just to draw near.<br><br>

I will not feed what isn’t right,<br>
Or walk away from every fight.<br>
I speak because I hope you’ll grow,<br>
Not stay where ego makes you low.<br>
What gain is mine in pushing back,<br>
When all I want is what we lack?<br><br>

I thought my words might change your view,<br>
At least a little — a percent or two.<br>
But you remind me, day by day,<br>
That hearts don’t shift just when we say.<br><br>

Still, I try — though I seem cold,<br>
My care for you is quiet, bold.<br>
I’m not expressive, that is true,<br>
But silence doesn’t mean untrue.<br><br>

I don’t explain myself to all,<br>
But when I try, I give my all.<br>
I hoped you’d see the love I send —<br>
Not through loud words, but how I bend.<br><br>

You hurt me sometimes, more than you see,<br>
But I never walked away from "we."<br>
You still mean more than you might know,<br>
Even if I no longer show.<br><br>

So no, I won’t obey what’s wrong —<br>
But I’ll stay, and I’ll stand strong.<br>
Because I care, and always will,<br>
Even when we both sit still.<br><br>

And though this path may shake or bother —<br>
Through all of it,<br>
I still call you my brother.
    </div>

    <p>
      If I could give you one gift today, it wouldn’t be something you unwrap.  
      It would be understanding.  
      It would be knowing that, even in silence, you’ve always mattered.  
      Even in distance, I’ve still cared.  
      And even in disagreement, I’ve still stood by you — just not always in ways you expected.
    </p>

    <p>
      Happy Birthday, Vinay.  
      May this year bring you growth, healing, and moments that remind you:  
      <strong>You are never unloved.</strong>  
      You are still — and always — my brother.
    </p>

    <div class="footer">
      With quiet strength and all my heart,<br>
      Your Sister <span class="heart">❤️</span>
